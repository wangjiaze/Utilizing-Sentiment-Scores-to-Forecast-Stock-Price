Abstract 

This study explores the impact of news sentiment on stock price prediction using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. Using a pre-trained RoBERTa model for sentiment scoring for financial news headlines and this is combined with technical factors for stock price prediction. Lasso and Ridge regression models are employed for prediction, with time-series cross-validation used for evaluation. Results show that sentiment scores significantly impact the prediction of certain stocks, such as FXI, but have less influence on others, like Tesla. While the models explain a substantial portion of stock price variation, further research is needed to enhance their robustness.
